How to use Git from the command line.



Local/Remote:

Local repositories and branches are essentially the same as GitHub but on your local device. 
Branches can be made from the local master branch, changes can be made to local branches, which can then be merged with the local master branch. 
Remote branches are by convention listed with the prefix origin/ (e.g. origin/master, origin/working etc.)


Command Line WorkFlow:

A good starting point is to check the current status of the local git:

1. Navigate to the local git repository
2. git status
4. git pull (origin [branch name] for specific branch) no option if latest commit required
3. Make changes
4. git add -A
5. git commit
6. git push origin [branch name]


This should list all of the current changes in the local repository, update the local branch from the remote one,
then edit, add any changes to staging area, update the local branch, then update the remote branch.




Additionally, you can view any changes to local branches using:
git log 
or
git log --summary

NEXT you can add any changes you have made to the 'staging area' with:
git add -a <file>


or add all changed files with:
git add -A


Then to update the current local branchL
git commit -m "[commit message]"


To merge another branch with the currently active one use:
git merge [branch name]


To merge the current active branch with another local branch, or merge two local branches use:
git merge [source branch] [target branch]

To publish the active local branch to a remote branch:
git push origin [branch name]

To update the local repository to the newest commit use:
git pull

To update a local branch from a remote use:
git pull origin [branch name]
