TODO: Need to clean the output for export to csv file. Maybe include a query to save to csv, use pandas:

pd.DataFrame(np_array).to_csv("path/to/file.csv")

^^^maybe make location dependent on operating system? where should the file be stored? ask for user input??

TODO: Create a function and/or class(?) to convert numpy array into sql
datatypes see https://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html#using-adapters-to-store-additional-python-types-in-sqlite-databases
